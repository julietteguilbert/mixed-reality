## Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets

The Windows 10 April 2018 Update includes many improvements for using Windows Mixed Reality headsets with your desktop PC, such as: 

* A brand-new environment called Skyloft that you can navigate to by selecting Places on the Mixed Reality Start menu.
* Support for haptic feedback when using motion controllers in SteamVR games in combination with the latest version of Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR.
* Improved performance in SteamVR games with lower video RAM usage. Live video preview in the Mixed Reality Portal on desktop is also more performant. 
* You can now take mixed reality photos directly from your controller by holding the Windows button and then tapping the trigger. This works across environments and apps except for capturing content protected with DRM.
* The automatic performance settings have been updated to provide an optimized experience, and weâ€™ve added a new setting to override the default in Settings > Mixed Reality > Headset display.
* Setup now provides more detailed information about common compatibility issues with USB3.0 controllers and graphics cards.

## Known issues

We've worked hard to deliver a great Windows Mixed Reality experience, but we're still tracking some known issues. If you find others, please [Give us feedback](give-us-feedback.md).


### Visual quality
* If you notice after the April 2018 upgrade that graphics is more blurry or the field of view looks smaller on your headset, the automatic performance setting is using low visual quality in order to maintain a sufficient framerate on a less powerful graphics card (such as Nvidia 1050).  You can manually override this if you choose by changing Settings > Mixed Reality > Headset display > Experience options to 90hz, then changing visual quality (on the same Settings page)to High.

### Windows Mixed Reality setup
* When setting up Windows with a headset connected, your PC monitor may go blank. Unplug your headset to enable output to your PC monitor to complete Windows setup.
* When creating a boundary, tracing may fail. If so, try again, as the system will learn more about your space over time.
* If you do not have headphones connected, you may miss additional tips when you first visit the Windows Mixed Reality home.
* Other Bluetooth devices can cause interference with motion controllers. If the motion controllers have connection/pairing/tracking issues, make sure the Bluetooth radio (if an external dongle) is plugged in to an unobstructed location and not immediately next to another Bluetooth dongle.  Also try powering down other Bluetooth peripherals during the Windows Mixed Reality sessions to see if it helps.

### Games and apps from Windows Store
* Some graphically intensive games, like Forza Motorsports 6, may cause performance issues on less capable PCs when played inside Windows Mixed Reality.

### Audio
* If you have Cortana enabled on your host PC prior to using your Windows Mixed Reality headset, you may lose the spatial sound simulation applied to the apps you place around the Windows Mixed Reality home. The work around is to enable "Windows Sonic for Headphones" on all the audio devices attached to your PC, even your headset-connected audio device:
   1. Left-click the speaker icon on the desktop taskbar and select from list of audio devices.
   2. Right-click the speaker icon on the desktop taskbar and select "Windows Sonic for Headphones" in the "Speaker setup" menu.
   3. Repeat these steps for all of your audio devices (endpoints).
>[!NOTE]
> - Another option is to turn off "Let Cortana respond to Hey Cortana" in **Settings** > **Cortana** on your desktop prior to launching Windows Mixed Reality.

* When another multimedia USB device (such as a web cam) shares the same USB hub (either external or inside your PC) with the Windows Mixed Reality headset, in rare cases the headset's audio jack/headphones may either have a buzzing sound or no audio at all. You can fix this by your headset into a USB port that does not share the same hub as the other device, or disconnect/disable your other USB multimedia device.
* In very rare cases, the host PC's USB hub cannot provide enough power to the Windows Mixed Reality headset and you may notice a burst of noise from the headphones connected to the headset.


### Holograms
* If you've placed a large number of holograms in your Windows Mixed Reality home, some may disappear and reappear as you look around. To avoid this, remove some of the holograms in that area of the Windows Mixed Reality home.

### Motion controllers
* Occasionally, if you click on a webpage in Edge, the content will zoom instead of click.

### Desktop app in the Windows Mixed Reality home
* Snipping Tool does not work in Desktop app.
* Desktop app does not persist setting on re-launch.
* If you're using Mixed Reality Portal preview on your desktop, when opening the Desktop app in the Windows Mixed Reality home, you may notice the infinite mirror effect. 
* Running the Desktop app may cause performance issues on non-Ultra Windows Mixed Reality PCs; it is not recommended.  
* Desktop app may auto-launch because an invisible window on Desktop has focus. 
* Desktop User Account Control prompt will make headset display black until the prompt is completed.
